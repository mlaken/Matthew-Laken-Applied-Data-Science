This repository contains projects I worked on throughout my Data Science studies in completion of my Masters in Applied Data Science. I began the program in October, 2020, after graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in Information Science from The University of Maryland. My goal is to understand how to apply the foundations of data science in a business setting, to help others make informed decisions by evaulating their data. I find that many business leaders know that they are collecting data, but are unsure how to propely extract and analyse it, which is why I decided my mission is to fill that gap with my expertise.
